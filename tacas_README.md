# HyperQB 2.0

**Artifact ID:** `97`  
**Paper Title:** `HyperQB 2.0: A Bounded Model Checker for Hyperproperties` (tool paper submission 0087)  
**Zenodo DOI:** `10.5281/zenodo.17490665`  
**Zenodo Record:** `https://zenodo.org/records/17490665`

This artifact provides a **Docker image** (distributed via **Docker Hub**) that contains our full experimental environment and the **shell scripts** needed to reproduce the tables reported in the paper. The AEC only needs to (1) install Docker, (2) pull our image from Docker Hub, (3) load it into Docker, and (4) run the provided scripts inside the container to regenerate the results.

**Our artifact is available on both Zenodo and Docker Hub. For simplicity, the instructions below use the Docker Hub version as [OPTION1] (and the Zenodo version as [OPTION2]).**

**Expected outputs:** Printed in Console and logged in `_outfiles` directory.

## Important Updates for TACAS Reviewers

We sincerely thank all reviewers for running the SmokeTest and provided feedback on our artifact. We notice that all three reviewers are all using *AMD64* machines, as a result, we have built an *AMD64* image. 

Please see our updates w.r.t this new image in **[OPTION 1]: Obtain the Artifact Image from Docker Hub** and make sure you pull the right image according to your architecture. Then, we kindly as you to run the following commands to verify the setup is successful: 

- `./run_hltl_1.sh -compare all`
- `./run_hltl_2.sh -compare all`
- `./run_ahltl.sh -compare all`
- `./run_loopcond.sh -all`
- `./run_verilog.sh -all`

With this new *AMD64* image, we believe the issues that Reviewer 1 and 2 encountered will be resolved. We notice that Reviewer 3 is use emulator (podman+qemu) to run our original *ARM64* image; however, we notice that this approach gives significant overhead on our dependencies (i.e., z3 and QuABs). Hence, we also kindly as Reviewer 3 to try the new *AMD64* image for evaluation. 

We also thank Reviewer 2 for spotting the typos in README. We have corrected them.

2. After installation, launch Docker Desktop and wait until it says **“Docker is running.”**

### Windows 10/11

1. Install **Docker Desktop for Windows**.
2. Ensure **Virtualization** is enabled in BIOS if prompted.
3. Launch Docker Desktop and wait until it says **“Docker is running.”**

> On Windows, we recommend using **PowerShell** for the commands below.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/etc.)

Install the Docker Engine from your distribution or Docker’s official repository. For Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Run as a regular user with sudo privileges
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg   | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo   "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg]   https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable"   | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

_(Fedora / Arch / others: use your package manager or Docker’s instructions.)_

---

## Verify Docker Works

Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
docker --version
docker run --rm hello-world
```

You should see **“Hello from Docker!”** If this works, Docker is correctly installed.

---

### <mark>(!!!) Important note on internet access during artifact setup</mark>

We are fully aware of the internet access restrictions during the TACAS artifact evaluation. Therefore, we provide two alternative options:

**[OPTION 1]**: Pull the HyperQB image from Docker Hub

**[OPTION 2]**: Download the HyperQB image from Zenodo (**ARM64 Only**)

We recommend using [OPTION 1]. However, if pulling directly from Docker Hub is not possible, the image is also available for download from our permanent online repository on Zenodo. This serves as a flexible alternative in case one of the options does not work on the reviewer’s machine.

---

## [OPTION 1]: Obtain the Artifact Image from Docker Hub

The artifact is distributed as a public Docker image hosted on Docker Hub.

Please ensure you have an active internet connection and Docker is running.

### Choosing the Correct Docker Image

Two architecture-specific images are available on Docker Hub:

- `rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:amd64` – for Intel/AMD (x86_64) machines
- `rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:arm64` – for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and other ARM64 machines

#### macOS / Linux

Check your CPU architecture:

```bash
uname -m
```

If you see x86_64, use `rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:amd64`.

If you see arm64 or aarch64, use `rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:arm64`.

#### Windows

Most Windows PCs use **AMD64**. If you’re using WSL2, run `uname -m` inside WSL to learn about your architecture.

### Running the container

Because the artifact runs inside a Docker container, any generated outputs and logs remain inside the container’s filesystem and are lost when the container exits. To preserve these files, you should mount a directory from your host machine into the container so that all generated outputs are written directly to your local filesystem.

To begin, navigate to the directory from which you want to run the Docker image. Then create a new directory named `_outfiles` to store all output produced by HyperQB 2.0. You can create it with the following command:

#### macOS / Linux (Terminal)

```bash
# Create a directory to store outputs
mkdir -p _outfiles

# run the image
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/_outfiles:/build/HyperRUSTY/_outfiles" \
  rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:[tag] \
  bash
```

where `[tag]` is the architecture of your system identified earlier (replace with either **ARM64** or **AMD64**).

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create a directory to store outputs
mkdir _outfiles

# Run the image
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "${PWD}/_outfiles:/build/HyperRusty/_outfiles" \
  rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:[tag] \
  bash
```

where `[tag]` is the architecture of your system identified earlier (replace with either **ARM64** or **AMD64**).

You are now inside the HyperQB2.0 Docker image.

> **File size note:** The tarball can be several GB. Ensure sufficient disk space and a stable network connection.

---

## [OPTION2] Download Docker image from Zenodo

**Notice**: This image is only for **ARM64** architecture. If you have an **AMD64** system, please follow Option 1 above.

From our Zenodo link (https://zenodo.org/records/17490665), download the `.tar` that contains the Docker image, then run:

```bash
docker load -i hyperqb2.tar
```

next, check if the image is loaded by running:

```bash
docker images
```

If the image is loaded correctly, you should be able to see the `hyperqb-docker` entry:

```
REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
hyperqb-docker        latest    41ea36748c37   18 minutes ago      7.87GB
```

Finally, to run this image, follow the instructions below.

Because the artifact runs inside a Docker container, any generated outputs and logs remain inside the container’s filesystem and are lost when the container exits. To preserve these files, you should mount a directory from your host machine into the container so that all generated outputs are written directly to your local filesystem.

To begin, navigate to the directory from which you want to run the Docker image. Then create a new directory named `_outfiles` to store all output produced by HyperQB 2.0. You can create it with the following command:

#### macOS / Linux (Terminal)

```bash
# Create a directory to store outputs
mkdir -p _outfiles

# run the image
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/_outfiles:/build/HyperRUSTY/_outfiles" \
  hyperqb-docker:[tag] \
  bash
```
where `[tag]` is the architecture of your system identified earlier (replace with either **ARM64** or **AMD64**).

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create a directory to store outputs
mkdir _outfiles

# Run the image
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "${PWD}/_outfiles:/build/HyperRusty/_outfiles" \
  hyperqb-docker:[tag] \
  bash
```
where `[tag]` is the architecture of your system identified earlier (replace with either **ARM64** or **AMD64**).

You are now inside the HyperQB2.0 Docker image.

## Inside the Docker Container, stage 1: Smoke Test

We provide easy-to-use shell scripts tailored for the early light review. To facilitate quick testing, we set a small `TIMEOUT` value in these scripts, allowing reviewers to run through all cases efficiently.

To ensure that all tables are reproducible and ready for further evaluation, please execute the following command:

- `./run_hltl_1.sh -compare all`
- `./run_hltl_2.sh -compare all`
- `./run_ahltl.sh -compare all`
- `./run_loopcond.sh -all`
- `./run_verilog.sh -all`

If no errors are reported, the smoke test is successful!

---

## Inside the Container, stage 2: Reproduce Experiments

We now describe in detail how to reproduce the complete results presented in the paper. To ensure correct execution, <mark>please adjust the `TIMEOUT` parameter defined at the top (line 5) of each shell script according to your machine’s setup.<mark/> We leave this value for reviewers to determine based on their computing environment.

## Collecting Outputs

All outputs are printed to the screen during execution and simultaneously logged in the `_outfiles` directory.


---

## Reusability 

To check if HyperQB 2.0 compiled without error, execute: 
```bash
cargo build --release
``` 
The compiled binary can be found in `target/release/`.


To test if HyperQB (SMT unrolling) can successfully compiled 
```bash
cargo run --release -- -n benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/bakery3.smv benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/bakery3.smv -f benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/symmetry3.hq -k 10 -s hpes
```
which should return `result: unsat` 

To test if HyperQB (QBF unrolling with `quabs`) can successfully run: 

```bash
cargo run --release -- -n benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/bakery3.smv benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/bakery3.smv -f benchmarks/sync/1_bakery/symmetry3.hq -k 10 -s hpes
```
which should return `UNSAT`


To test if HyoerQB (with verilog input using `yosys`) can successfully run:
```bash
cargo run --release -- -v benchmarks/verilog/divider/divider.ys benchmarks/verilog/divider/divider.ys -t divider -o model.smt2 -f benchmarks/verilog/divider/formula.hq -k 8 -s pes
```
which should return `result:unsat`


### HyperQB 2.0 CLI Usage

We here provide detailed instruction to reuse HyperQB2.0

### Synopsis

```bash
cargo run --release -- (-n|-v) <models> -f <formula> -k <int> -s <sem> [options]
```

### Arguments

**Required**
- `-n <files>` | `-v <files>`: NuSMV or Verilog model files.
- `-f <file>`: Hyperproperty formula (`.hq`).
- `-t <name>`: Top module (Verilog only, defaults to `main`).
- `-k <int>` | `-l`: Unrolling bound in steps or enable loop conditions.
- `-s <pes|opt|hpes|hopt>`: Bounded semantics selection.

**Optional**
- `-m <int>`: Trajectory bound for AH-LTL fragments.
- `-c`: Emit counterexample when the formula is unsatisfied.
- `-q`: Use the QuAbS QBF solver instead of Z3.

### CLI Example

Try the following example, which model check `linearizability (lin.hq)` on `SNARK algorithm (snark1_conc.smv, snark1_seq.smv)`:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -n benchmarks/sync/2_snark/snark1_conc.smv benchmarks/sync/2_snark/snark1_seq.smv -f benchmarks/sync/2_snark/lin.hq -k 18 -s hpes -c
```
which should return `UNSAT` with `counterexample` displayed in your terminal. 


---

We would like to remark that, outside of this artifact, we offer a fully standalone **macOS application** (available for download from GitHub) with an **interactive GUI** (demonstrated on page 5 of the manual). Comprehensive information about the tool’s theoretical background, algorithms, case studies (including model descriptions), and an online version of the GUI is also accessible through our **official website**. Since these components are beyond the TACAS artifact evaluation scope, we provide here only the CLI binary for reviewers to interact with directly. However, HyperQB 2.0 is easy to adapt for future research to benefit the formal methods community.

---


## Notices

### Notice 1: During the preparation of the artifact, we discovered that the first two cases in the Loop Peeling benchmarks (`LP` and `LP_ndet`) contained a minor bug in the model. After correcting it, the QBF timings differed from those originally reported in the paper. Furthermore, the first ELFP entry is UNSAT; the checkmark shown in the paper is a typo.

### Notice 2: While preparing the artifact for the Verilog case studies, we discovered that using the `-c` option, even on satisfiable (SAT) results, significantly improves Z3's solver performance.

We sincerely thank the Artifact Evaluation Committee for their time and feedback.
