# HyperQB 2.0

**Artifact ID:** `97`  
**Paper Title:** `HyperQB 2.0: A Bounded Model Checker for Hyperproperties` (submission 0087)   
**Zenodo DOI:** `10.5281/zenodo.17490665`  
**Zenodo Record:** `https://zenodo.org/records/17490665`

This artifact provides a **Docker image** (distributed via **Docker Hub**) that contains our full experimental environment and the **shell scripts** needed to reproduce the tables reported in the paper. The AEC only needs to (1) install Docker, (2) pull our image from Docker Hub, (3) load it into Docker, and (4) run the provided scripts inside the container to regenerate the results.

**Our artifact is available on both Zenodo and Docker Hub. For simplicity, the instructions below use the Docker Hub version.**

**Expected outputs:** Printed in Console and logged in `_outfiles` directory.

## Install Docker

Choose **one** of the following:

### macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)

1. Install **Docker Desktop for Mac**.
2. After installation, launch Docker Desktop and wait until it says **“Docker is running.”**

### Windows 10/11

1. Install **Docker Desktop for Windows**.
2. Ensure **Virtualization** is enabled in BIOS if prompted.
3. Launch Docker Desktop and wait until it says **“Docker is running.”**

> On Windows, we recommend using **PowerShell** for the commands below.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/etc.)

Install the Docker Engine from your distribution or Docker’s official repository. For Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Run as a regular user with sudo privileges
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg   | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo   "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg]   https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable"   | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

_(Fedora / Arch / others: use your package manager or Docker’s instructions.)_

---

## Verify Docker Works

Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
docker --version
docker run --rm hello-world
```

You should see **“Hello from Docker!”** If this works, Docker is correctly installed.

---

### <mark>(!!!) Important remark when we are building this image</mark>

We are full aware of the internet access constraint for artifact evaluation. As a result we provide two options:

[OPTION 1]: pull our built image from docker hub
[OPTION 2]: download out built image from Zenodo

We recommend [OPTION 1], however, if direct pull from Docker Hub is not allowed, we also have the image downloadable from the permanent online repository Zenodo. 


---

## [OPTION 1]: Obtain the Artifact Image from Docker Hub

The artifact is distributed as a public Docker image hosted on Docker Hub.

Please ensure you have an active internet connection and Docker is running.

### macOS / Linux (Terminal)

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir -p ~/tacas-ae && cd ~/tacas-ae

# Pull the latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:latest

```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create a working directory (optional)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$HOME\tacas-ae" | Out-Null
Set-Location "$HOME\tacas-ae"

# Pull the latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull rogaleke/hyperqb2.0:latest
```

> **File size note:** The tarball can be several GB. Ensure sufficient disk space and a stable network connection.

---

## Run the Container (Interactive Shell)

Start the container with sensible defaults. **Copy exactly one** of the following run commands.

### macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
# Basic run
docker run --rm -it hyperqb2.0:latest
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
docker run --rm -it hyperqb2.0:latest
```

> **What this does:**
>
> - `--rm` cleans up when you exit.
> - `-it` gives you an interactive shell.

You should now see a shell prompt **inside** the container, typically like:  
`root@<container-id>:/workspace#`

---

## [OPTION2] Download docker image from Zenodo 

From our Zenodo link (https://zenodo.org/records/17490665), download the `.tar` that contains the docker image, then run:
```bash
docker load -i hyperqb2.tar
```
next, check if the image is loaded by running:
```bash
docker images
```
if the image is loaded correctly, you should be able to see the `hyperqb-docker` entry:
```
REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
hyperqb-docker        latest    41ea36748c37   18 minutes ago      7.87GB
``` 
finally, run this image:
```bash
docker run -it hyperqb-docker:latest
```
you are now in a ready-to-go environment to run HyperQB!

## Inside the Container, phase 1: Smoke Test

We provide easy-to-use shell scripts for the early light review. We achieve it by setting the `TIMEOUT` on the shell scripts to a small number, where the reviewers can easily go through all the cases quickly. 
To make sure all tables are reproducible, please execute:
`./run_hltl_1.sh -compare all`
`./run_hltl_2.sh -compare all`
`./run_ahltl -all`
`./run_loopcond.sh -all`
`./run_verilog -all`

If no errors is reported, the smoke test is successful!

## Notices

### Notice 1: During the preparation of the artifact, we discovered that the first two cases in the Loop Peeling benchmarks (`LP` and `LP_ndet`) contained a minor bug in the model. After correcting it, the QBF timings differed from those originally reported in the paper.

### Notice 2: While preparing the artifact for the Verilog case studies, we discovered that using the `-c` option, even on satisfiable (SAT) results, significantly improves Z3's solver performance.

We thank the Artifact Evaluation Committee for their time and feedback.
