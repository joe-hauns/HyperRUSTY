# HyperQB-2.0


## TACAS 2026 arfifact evaluation requirements



### "A hyperlink to the artifact"

TBD!!!!!!

### "Additional requriements and installation" 
> "Additional requirements for the artifact, such as installation of proprietary software or particular hardware resources"

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) (tested with version 25.0.3) and **start the Docker demon**. 


TBD!!!!!!


### "Detailed instructions for smoke test"
> "Detailed instruction for an early smoke test review that allows reviewers to: (1) verify that the artifact can properly run; and (2) perform a short evaluation of the artifact before the full evaluation and detect any difficulties (see Rebuttal)"

We prepare several easy-to-use shell script for smoke test. The purpose is to have the reviewers quickly test each scripts that aims at reproducing the empirical results in out paper. We write one script per table: 
1) `run_hltl_1.sh`      : Reproducing Table 4 "HyperLTL benchmarks from citation 22"

First, ensure that all light cases with SMT run smoothly:
```bash
./run_hltl_1.sh -light smt
```

Next, ensure that all light cases with QBF run smoothly: 
```bash
./run_hltl_1.sh -light qbf
```
If any error shows up for the above case, please check the previous section `setup.sh` again.


Finally, make sure AutoHyper (the baseline tool we compared with) execute smoothly:
```bash
./run_hltl_1.sh -light ah
```

If all of the above succeed, try to run the following command that runs all 3 modes:
```bash
./run_hltl_1.sh -compare light
```
And, make sure they can output witnesses:
```bash
./run_hltl_1.sh -compare light give_witness
```








1) `run_hltl_2.sh`      : Reproducing Table 5 "New HyperLTL benchmarks"
2) `run_ahltl.sh`       : Reproducing Table 5 "A-HLTL benchamrks from citation 20"
3) `run_loopcond.sh`    : Reproducing Table 7 "Loop condition benchmarks from citation 21"
4) `run_verilog`        : Reproducing Table 8 "Selected case studies in Verilog" 





### "Detailed instructions for replication of results in the paper"
> "Detailed instructions for use of the artifact and replication of results in the paper, including estimated resource use and required time if non-trivial"



### "List of badges we are applying"
> "List of badges you are applying for in your submission. In particular, if you are not applying for the Reusable badge, please indicate it?\"




### "Platform tested"
> "Platforms you tested this on (in particular: the host architecture: arm64 vs amd64, the operating system, etc.)"

### Additions notes by the HyperQB-2.0 team



#### Verilog 

While preparing the artifact on the Verilog case studies we discovered that using the `-c` option even on sat results results in much better solver performance for Z3.
